# 🚀 How Will AppointMe Stand Out?

The key differentiator for **AppointMe** lies in its **creator-first approach**. It’s not just a booking tool—it’s a platform for creators to build their personal brand and showcase their portfolio.

## 🎯 Unique & Innovative Features:
- 🔔 Automatic email reminders to reduce missed appointments

# 💲 Pricing Compared to Competitors

Compared to other similar platforms, **AppointMe** stands out because of its **transparent and affordable pricing**.

Competitors like **Calendly**, **Booksy**, **Square Appointments**, and others do offer free plans — but these are often limited in functionality and feel more like free trials. To unlock essential features, users are typically pushed toward **premium plans** that **start around €25/month** — and even then, some features remain locked behind higher-tier subscriptions.

### ✅ What Makes AppointMe Different?

**AppointMe** will offer:

- 💡 **One simple plan** — no confusing tiers  
- 🚀 **All features unlocked** for just **€8/month**  
- 🆓 **1-month free trial** — cancel anytime before being charged  
- 🔓 No upsells, no hidden fees — everything creators need in one affordable package

With this approach, **AppointMe** not only keeps things simple but also becomes one of the most **budget-friendly and feature-complete** options on the market.
