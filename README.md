📊 SWOT Analysis – Project AppointMe
Strengths (S)
Simple and intuitive booking process without registration required for visitors.
Integrated Instagram profile display allows visitors to view the creator’s work directly on the booking page.
Enables smaller creators (e.g., hairdressers, tattoo artists, etc.) to accept appointments easily without relying on Instagram DMs or other platforms—especially useful if they don’t have their own website.
Business owners can easily define available time slots, and users receive automatic email reminders to prevent no-shows.
Weaknesses (W)
High competition in the online booking space.
Booking requires a stable internet connection.
Low brand recognition as the platform is new.
Opportunities (O)
Increasing number of new creators without personal websites—potential future clients.
Potential to develop a mobile app in the future for easier appointment management.
Threats (T)
Competitive market with established alternatives.
Necessity of protecting users' personal data, such as email addresses and names.

🚀 How Will AppointMe Stand Out?
The key differentiator for AppointMe lies in its creator-first approach. It’s not just a booking tool—it’s a platform for creators to build their personal brand and showcase their portfolio.
